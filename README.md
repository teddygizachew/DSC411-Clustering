# DSC411-Clustering

Group Assignment

Implements the Bisecting K-means algorithm in Python. The program determines the optimal value of K using Silhouette Coefficient approach.

It accepts a CSV file that has a varied set of features. You may use the Euclidean algorithm as your proximity measure or any other proximity measure of your choice. (You may choose a different distance measure for this assignment) You can use this CSV

The program outputs a printout of the centroids and the SSE. We also return the original dataset with cluster assignments. Additionally, we created a 3D visualization using the first 3 features of the dataset.
