# Bisecting K-means algorithm

Implementation of the Bisecting K-means clustering algorithm in Python with some additional methods for initializing centroids, calculating SSE, and getting labels for data points to clusters. 


It accepts a CSV file that has a varied set of features. You may use the Euclidean algorithm as your proximity measure or any other proximity measure of your choice. (You may choose a different distance measure for this assignment) You can use this CSV

The program outputs a printout of the centroids and the SSE. We also return the original dataset with cluster assignments. Additionally, we created a 3D visualization using the first 3 features of the dataset.
